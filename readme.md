# WKP6 - Hungry Student Restaurant

### Another website about food, really...

Yes, but who doesn't like food? üòÑ

This time, we're going to build a food delivery app, where we can see the meal options, select them, and see the result in our cart.

## 1- What I have done with this exercise

- I drag the elements wich I need from the html
- I created htmls for lists including spicy lists and vegetarian lists
- I called the objects of an array inside the lists that I need
- I created another html to add the order list in a menu
- I created a Modal to tell that the clients have comfirmed their foods by clicking the comfirm button

## 2- Difficulties

I faced a lot of problems wich is not solved till now

  - Getting the output into the order list
  - Setting the progess of how often do the clients ordered the foods by using multiplication
  - Increasing the ammount of what they ordered
  - Giving the total ammount of the foods that is ordered
## 3- Things needed to improve

- Calling back an element from the html thatt is created in the js

- I don't know how to use reduce with the array of object.

### ****Message***
I am so sorry that I didn't solve many things in this project. I really didn't find any way to solve them. I still need some push from anyone especially our teacher.
**Thanks !!***

#### *****Good thing****

There are no errors in the console log in the browser

### Users must be able to :

-   See a list of five meal options
-   See the prices of each meal option
-   Add a meal to the cart
-   Filter the list to see only the vegetarian meals, or only the spicy ones
-   See their total bill
-   ‚ÄúCheck out‚Äù - this doesn‚Äôt have to process payment, just simply display
    a message stating the order as been confirmed.

### Bonus :

-   Change the quantity of meals in the cart
-   Remove a meal from the cart

Here is an example of layout :

And when I click on the _Confirm Order_ button, I can display a message to show the total bill from the order.

### Food list

Here's the food object :

```jsx
const foods = [
	{
		id: 'ravitoto',
		price: 5000,
		title: 'Ravitoto',
		spicy: true,
		vegetarian: false,
	},
	{
		id: 'pasta',
		price: 4000,
		title: 'Pasta',
		spicy: true,
		vegetarian: true,
	},
	{
		id: 'burger',
		price: 5000,
		title: 'Burger',
		spicy: false,
		vegetarian: false,
	},
	{
		id: 'rice',
		price: 2000,
		title: 'Rice and Leaves',
		spicy: false,
		vegetarian: true,
	},
	{
		id: 'mofogasy',
		price: 500,
		title: 'Mofogasy',
		spicy: false,
		vegetarian: false,
	},
];
```

The **id** here is a unique string, is role is to identify an element inside the list. The title will be the food name shown to the user.

You'll also have an **order** collection, where you will push a food object every time the user add an element to his order.

### Maps, Filter, Reduce, and other friends

-   To generate any list of element (for example, the list of food), **Map** is really useful.
-   To get the full price of list of items, **Reduce** is the perfect use case.
-   To count how many times an item is in a list, you could **Filter** the list and see the length of the result, or use a **Reduce** to count all of the instances.

But this is just one way to think about that. Feel free to try any other logic you have in mind.

### üí°Tips

-   Don't forget to clean your code, and update your readme before Monday morning.

Good luck!
