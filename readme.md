# WKP6 - Hungry Student Restaurant

### Another website about food, really...

Yes, but who doesn't like food? ðŸ˜„

This time, we're going to build a food delivery app, where we can see the meal options, select them, and see the result in our cart.

## 1- What I have done with this exercise

- I drag the elements wich I need from the html
- I created htmls for lists including spicy lists and vegetarian lists
- I called the objects of an array inside the lists that I need
- I created another html to add the order list in a menu
- I created a Modal to tell that the clients have comfirmed their foods by clicking the comfirm button

## 2- Difficulties

I faced a lot of problems wich is not solved till now

  - Getting the output into the order list
  - Setting the progess of how often do the clients ordered the foods by using multiplication
  - Increasing the ammount of what they ordered
  - Giving the total ammount of the foods that is ordered

## 3- Things needed to improve

- Calling back an element from the html that is created in the js

- I don't know how to use reduce with the array of object.

## 4- Something new

Using e.preventDefault(), it is not new but I was still tricked when I used submit. I used it then the first submition didn't work and I was stacked because I didn't know that it was because of that, likely I knew it before I left school and it didn't ovverride the first one anymore.

## 5- More explanation

I need more explanation on how to drag the element from the html that created in js. In addition, I would like to have more information about distruction and totaling something from an array of object.

### ****Message***
I am so sorry that there are many things in this project. I really didn't find any way to solve them. I still need some push from anyone especially our teacher.
**Thanks !!***
